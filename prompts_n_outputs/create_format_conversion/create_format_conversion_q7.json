"{\n    \"new_question\": \"In no more than two sentences, define the p-value in hypothesis testing and explain what a small p-value indicates.\",\n    \"correct_answer\": \"The p-value is the probability of obtaining data at least as extreme as the observed sample, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value indicates the observed result is unlikely under the null and provides evidence against the null hypothesis.\"\n}"
